This Project is a frontend Project designed in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and implemented using React. We have used REDUX-TOOLKIT to make a store which can be accessed throughout the app. A movie api has been 
used to get the movies. Async thunks have also been used in the reduc Slice to get the movies. Just run the 'npm start' command to have a look at the project on your localhost.
